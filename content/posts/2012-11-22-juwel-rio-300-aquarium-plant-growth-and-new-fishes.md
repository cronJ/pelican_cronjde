10 days ago, I took a photo with the current state of my aquarium after I planted it new. Now there are some changes.

There are new fish which live in the middle and top area of the aquarium, so it isn't so empty there anymore. My _Ancistrus_ gave birth and I now have 15 new ones, at least this amount I could count until now. They also hide in my filter, so I have to check that they can escape there.

Here is the photo 10 days ago:

And this is from today:

And here a photo of one of the new _Ancistrus_. Not so easy to take a photo of them.

One of the new fish is 12 _Danio margaritatus_ which have a beautiful color. They have little dots on their body and the fins have strong, orange colors.

Also, I got another 18 _Trigonostigma_. With their black triangle on the body and orange fins, they are matching perfectly with the _Danio margaritatus_.

Both species are harmless to my shrimps, which was important for me. And now we have some more movement in the top half of the aquarium.
